Title: Exploring the Water Cycle
Grade: 6

Everything after the --- is the actual lesson content.
The water cycle describes how water moves on, above, and below Earth’s surface. It involves continuous processes that recycle Earth’s water supply.

Key Ideas

    Evaporation
    Liquid water from oceans, lakes, and rivers heats up and turns into water vapor.

    Condensation
    Water vapor cools in the atmosphere and forms tiny droplets, creating clouds.

    Precipitation
    When droplets combine and grow heavy, they fall as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

    Collection
    Precipitated water gathers in bodies of water or infiltrates the soil, replenishing groundwater.

Practice Problems

    Explain what happens to water molecules during evaporation.

    Draw and label the four main stages of the water cycle.

    Describe how condensation leads to cloud formation.

    List three different forms of precipitation and give an example location for each.

    Imagine you live near a pond: outline the path a single drop of water might take through the entire water cycle.
