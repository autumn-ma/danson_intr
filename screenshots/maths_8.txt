# (Everything after the --- is the actual lesson content.)
A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form ax + b = c, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0.

Key Ideas
1. Solving by isolating x
2. Checking solutions
3. Real-world examples (distance, rate, time)

Practice Problems
1. 3x + 4 = 16
2. 5(x – 2) = 20
3. A train travels 120 km at a constant speed of 60 km/h. Write and solve an equation for the time t.
